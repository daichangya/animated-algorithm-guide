# Algorithm Visualization Guide

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualization Learning Platform! This platform helps you deeply understand algorithm principles through interactive animations.

## Available Algorithm Categories

1. **Diff Algorithms**
   - [Myers Diff Algorithm](diff/myers-diff.md)
   - [Improved Myers Algorithm](diff/myers-diff-improved.md)
   - [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](diff/lcs.md)

2. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - [Bubble Sort](sorting/bubble-sort.md)
   - [Quick Sort](sorting/quick-sort.md)
   - [Merge Sort](sorting/merge-sort.md)
   - [Heap Sort](sorting/heap-sort.md)

## Platform Features

✔ Interactive visualizations (click algorithm names to experience)  
✔ Bilingual documentation support  
✔ Detailed algorithm explanations  
✔ Practical code examples  

## Quick Start

1. Click the algorithm links above to view visualizations
2. Read the corresponding algorithm documentation

> Tip: Use `mkdocs serve` to start a local server for live preview
